Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a final-year undergrad from India, originally diving deep into the world of Mechanical Engineeringâ€”but along the way, I found myself pulled into the exciting world of software and tech.

What started as a curiosity quickly turned into a passion. From building small scripts to working on full-stack projects and exploring machine learning, I've loved every bit of the journey. Iâ€™m especially interested in creating scalable, impactful solutions that bring real value to users.

With a background in mechanics and a minor in Computing & Intelligence, I enjoy bridging the gap between hardware and softwareâ€”and learning something new every day.

Feel free to check out my projects or connect. Always open to collaboration or a quick tech chat!
