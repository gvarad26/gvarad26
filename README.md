I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in India, with a longstanding passion for Mechanical Engineering. From a young age, I have been captivated
by machinesâ€”understanding their workings and exploring their potential to enhance our lives through innovation.
<br />
<br />
My early interests in mechanics, robotics, and electronics have guided me towards pursuing my undergraduate studies 
in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Computing and Intelligence. I have always aspired to leverage my skills to
contribute positively to society and make a meaningful impact on the world.
